CRAN packages are archived all the time, but a large portion of them
eventually gets fixed and return to CRAN.  Using public data available
from different resources[^1] on CRAN, we have found that 36% of the
archived packages get unarchived at some point [@revilla_2022]. The
median time for these packages to return to CRAN is ~33 days.

[^1]: Data sources used are `tools:::CRAN_current_db()`,
`tools:::CRAN_archive_db()`, and [PACKAGES.in].


## Analysis

### Summary of how long it takes packages to be unarchived

```{r table-times}
#| tbl-cap: "Table with Summary statistics of time to get back to CRAN."
fiu <- function(x){is(x, "difftime")}
pw |> summarise(.by = times_archived, 
                packages = n(), 
                min = min(timediff), 
                q1 = quantile(timediff, 0.25), 
                mean = mean(timediff), 
                median = median(timediff), 
                q3 = quantile(timediff, 0.75), 
                max = max(timediff)) |> 
  mutate(across(where(fiu), round)) |> 
  as.data.frame()
```


### Return time for packages archived only once in their lifetime

```{r plot-ecdf}
#| fig-cap: "ECDF of the time packaages get back to CRAN. Days vs % of packages back on CRAN."
library("ggplot2")
pw |> 
  filter(times_archived == "1") |>
  ggplot() +
  stat_ecdf(aes(timediff)) +
  coord_cartesian(xlim =  c(0, 365), expand = FALSE) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::label_percent()) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 30*1:12) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Time for packages to be back on CRAN for the first time",
       subtitle = "Focusing in packages in less than a year",
       y = "Percentage of packages back on CRAN",
       x = "Days till packages are back on CRAN")

```


### Cumulative number of archived packages over the years

```{r plot-cumulative}
#| fig-cap: "Packages situation in CRAN altered. Each line represents an action by the CRAN team. On the left the raw counts of cumulative , on the right the same in logarithmic scale."
library("patchwork")
p <- full_history |> 
  filter(!is.na(action), !is.na(date)) |> 
  arrange(date) |> 
  select(-comment) |> 
  group_by(action) |> 
  mutate(n = seq_len(n())) |> 
  ungroup() |> 
  ggplot() +
  geom_line(aes(date, n, col = action, linetype = action)) +
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "2 year", date_labels = "%Y",
               expand = expansion()) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Date of the archive",
       y = "Total number of packages"
  )
p + scale_y_continuous(expand = expansion()) + 
  p + scale_y_log10(guide = "axis_logticks", expand = expansion(), 
                    breaks = c(1, 100, 2500, 5000, 7500, 10000)) +
  plot_annotation(
    title = "Accumulation of actions on pacakges",
  ) +
  plot_layout(guides = 'collect', axes = "collect") &
  theme(legend.position='bottom')
```


### Days to return versus date when archived

```{r plot-events}
#| fig-cap: "Packages being archived and returning to CRAN. 
#| The points are packages, when they were archived from CRAN vs when they returned. 
#| The gray dashed line is the event horizon."
pw |> 
  ggplot() +
  geom_count(aes(archived, timediff)) +
  geom_abline(slope = -1, intercept = Sys.Date(), linetype = 2, col = "gray") +
  geom_rug(aes(archived, timediff), sides = "b", outside = TRUE, length = unit(0.015, "npc"), 
           col = "gray") +
  theme_minimal() +
  coord_cartesian(clip = "off") +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = expansion(c(0, NA), c(0, NA))) +
  labs(x = "Date when the package was archived",
       y = "Time until it went back to CRAN",
       title = "Time till archived packages are back to CRAN",
       size = "Packages")
```


### Distribution of number of days for packages to return to CRAN

```{r plot-distribution}
#| fig-cap: "**Histogram of packages by the time they are off CRAN**. 
#| Each bar represents a week. Most packages are less than a month off CRAN."
pw |> 
  ggplot() +
  geom_histogram(aes(timediff), binwidth = 7) +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = expansion(c(0, NA), c(0, NA))) +
  labs(y = "Packages that got back",
       x = "days",
       title = "Time till packages are back to CRAN")
```
