Sometimes the deadline is as short as two weeks.\nThe impact of a CRAN package being archived depends on the package, and how widely used it is, and how many packages depend on it. In some cases it can be rather disruptive for R users and developers when one or more packages are archived on CRAN.\nImportantly, any package that has a hard dependency (e.g. Depends: and Imports:) on an archived package will automatically be archived too. There is little a developer that is a “victim” of this can do, other than doing a major rewrite, which is only reasonable to do if the developer knows that the archived package will not be fixed anytime soon.\nThe purpose of this R package repository is to give archived CRAN packages a second chance. As soon as the package is archived on CRAN, it is added to this repository. If the packages is fixed and “unarchived” on CRAN, it is removed from this repository. If the package is not unarchived on CRAN within four weeks, it is removed from this repository. This gives R users, developers, and reverse-dependency maintainers some extra leeway."

If you don’t think you can reach the deadline you got, you might be able to convince the CRAN maintainers to extend the deadline. It is also useful to review CRAN Repository Policy once in a while to stay up to date with the CRAN requirements.\nIf your package has already been archived, you can get back to CRAN by fixing the issues pointed on the initial email, as well as any other new issue that might show up. Check the package before sending it and explain to the volunteers how you fixed it. If you have problems you don’t know how to solve, you can search for a solution in the r-package-devel mailing list and ask there for help with the package development"
