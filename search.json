However, there are currently 94 packages unarchived more times than archived. There could be several reasons for this:\n\none of the previous issues with the package lead to its removal.\nthe term used for annotating an event was different (‘orphaned’ instead of ‘archived’).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst action\nPackages\n\n\n\n\norphaned\n86\n\n\nremoved\n68\n\n\narchived\n21\n\n\nrenamed\n1\n\n\n\nFigure: First recorded action taken of a package. Looking by date most packages’ first action recorded is being added to CRAN. For some it isn’t.\n\n\nWe also check what the first recorded event packages have. If the first action recorded for a package is not that it is ‘accepted’, this can indicate some problems on the data that could lead to problems on the conclusions.\nA special mention of the ‘removed’ action: This action is usually reserved to copyright issues and it is normal that it is the first action in record for a package as previous records are removed too from CRAN (package source code).\nBy contrast, we should not expected lack of records on CRAN of ‘accepted’ packages. Based on the current data, this is the case for 135 packages. This could indicated that packages have been ‘renamed’ or ‘removed’. Another explanations could be that there was a dialogue between the package maintainers and the CRAN Team that lead to the package being ‘unarchived’ without new ‘accepted’ packages. It could be because of a missing entry in the CRAN data.\n\n\n\nTable: Events per package in the same date. Most packages have just one action per day. Unarchiving usually requires a new package’s version accepted the same day.\n\n\nMultiple actions\nEvents\n% events\n\n\n\n\n1\n60011\n86%\n\n\n2\n9101\n13%\n\n\n3\n331\n0%\n\n\n\n\n\nIn total there are 425 ‘unarchived’ events that do not have the corresponding ‘accepted’ package included event (on the same date). Currently, this is the case for 413 packages out of 9284 (4%).\nOn the contrary, there are some events that are not expected to happen on the same day:\n\n\n\nTable: Actions that happend on the same date in a given package. Mostly a new acceptance lead to a package being unarchived. In some occasions other actions.\n\n\nMultiple actions\nEvents\n%\n\n\n\n\naccepted & unarchived\n4344\n93.460%\n\n\naccepted & orphaned\n121\n2.603%\n\n\naccepted & archived & unarchived\n109\n2.345%\n\n\naccepted & archived\n63\n1.355%\n\n\narchived & unarchived\n7\n0.151%\n\n\naccepted & removed\n3\n0.065%\n\n\naccepted & orphaned & unarchived\n1\n0.022%\n\n\n\n\n\nThose with three different actions imply that there has been multiple revisions from the CRAN Team on the same day.\nIn total there are 622 different packages identified with problematic records/processing from 9284. Out of these, 118 were found to have two or more different issues. Depending on which issue, they might be corrected to the best of our abilities, or simply be discarded depending on the issue and question we are trying to answer."

Sometimes the deadline is as short as two weeks. In Revilla (2022), it was found that 36% of all archived CRAN package get “unarchived” again at some point in the future. Our results show that the median time for an archived package to reappear on CRAN is ~30 days.\nThe impact of a CRAN package being archived depends on the package, and how widely used it is, and how many packages depend on it. In some cases it can be rather disruptive for R users and developers when one or more packages are archived on CRAN.\nImportantly, any package that has a hard dependency (e.g. Depends: and Imports:) on an archived package will automatically be archived too. There is little a developer that is a “victim” of this can do, other than doing a major rewrite, which is only reasonable to do if the developer knows that the archived package will not be fixed anytime soon.\nThe purpose of this R package repository is to give archived CRAN packages a second chance. As soon as the package is archived on CRAN, it is added to this repository. If the packages is fixed and “unarchived” on CRAN, it is removed from this repository. If the package is not unarchived on CRAN within five weeks, it is removed from this repository. This gives R users, developers, and reverse-dependency maintainers some extra leeway."
