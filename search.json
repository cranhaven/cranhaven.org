    "text": "CRAN packages are often archived and equally often after being taken off CRAN they can be brought up to CRAN.\nThis dashboard updates with the latest 40 days of CRAN archived or unarchived packages from the document the CRAN team uses to document this process.\nTo avoid being archived follow CRAN policies fix the package in time. If you don’t think you can reach the deadline you got, you might be able to convince the CRAN maintainers to extend the deadline.\nIf your package has already been archived, you can get back to CRAN by fixing the issues pointed on the initial email, as well as any other new issue that might show up. Check the package before sending it and explain to the volunteers how you fixed it. If you have problems you don’t know how to solve, you can search for a solution in the r-package-devel mailing list and ask there for help with the package development\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBackground\nMany packages get back to CRAN after being archived:\n\n#&gt; [1] package     n_unarchive n_archive   k          \n#&gt; &lt;0 rows&gt; (or 0-length row.names)\n\n\n#&gt;   group packages     min      q1     mean       m       q3       max\n#&gt; 1     a     3652  1 days  9 days 121 days 33 days 120 days 3292 days\n#&gt; 2     b      769  1 days  8 days  91 days 27 days  87 days 1949 days\n#&gt; 3     c      203  1 days  6 days  80 days 22 days  76 days  882 days\n#&gt; 4     d       65  1 days  9 days  66 days 23 days  54 days  652 days\n#&gt; 5     e       16  1 days  3 days  24 days 13 days  31 days   93 days\n#&gt; 6     f        2 17 days 20 days  22 days 22 days  24 days   27 days"
