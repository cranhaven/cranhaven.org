    "text": "Motivation\n\n\n\n\n\nCRANhaven is where recently archived CRAN packages can find shelter and get time for maintenance\n\n\n\nSometimes a package gets archived only because the maintainer did not have time to address the issues before the deadline given by CRAN. Sometimes the deadline is as short as two weeks. In Revilla (2022), it was found that 36% of all archived CRAN package get “unarchived” again at some point in the future. Our results show that the median time for an archived package to reappear on CRAN is ~30 days.\nThe impact of a CRAN package being archived depends on the package, and how widely used it is, and how many packages depend on it. In some cases it can be rather disruptive for R users and developers when one or more packages are archived on CRAN.\nImportantly, any package that has a hard dependency (e.g. Depends: and Imports:) on an archived package will automatically be archived too. There is little a developer that is a “victim” of this can do, other than doing a major rewrite, which is only reasonable to do if the developer knows that the archived package will not be fixed anytime soon.\nThe purpose of this R package repository is to give archived CRAN packages a second chance. As soon as the package is archived on CRAN, it is added to this repository. If the packages is fixed and “unarchived” on CRAN, it is removed from this repository. If the package is not unarchived on CRAN within five weeks, it is removed from this repository. This gives R users, developers, and reverse-dependency maintainers some extra leeway."
