Using public data available\nfrom different resources[^1] on CRAN, we have found that 36% of the\narchived packages get unarchived at some point [@revilla_2022]. The\nmedian time for these packages to return to CRAN is ~33 days.\n\n[^1]: Data sources used are `tools:::CRAN_current_db()`,\n`tools:::CRAN_archive_db()`, and [PACKAGES.in].\n\n\n## Analysis\n\n### Summary of how long it takes packages to be unarchived\n\n\n::: {.cell tbl-cap='Table with Summary statistics of time to get back to CRAN.'}\n\n```\n#>   times_archived packages     min      q1     mean  median       q3       max\n#> 1              1     3661  1 days  9 days 122 days 33 days 121 days 3292 days\n#> 2              2      774  1 days  8 days  91 days 27 days  87 days 1949 days\n#> 3              3      203  1 days  6 days  80 days 22 days  76 days  882 days\n#> 4              4       68  1 days 10 days  72 days 23 days  66 days  652 days\n#> 5              5       16  1 days  3 days  24 days 13 days  31 days   93 days\n#> 6              6        3 17 days 22 days  30 days 27 days  36 days   45 days\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n### Return time for packages archived only once in their lifetime\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Empirical distribution of the time it takes packages to get unarchived as a function of number of days since being archived on CRAN.](cran-archiving-stats_files/figure-html/plot-ecdf-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n### Cumulative number of archived packages over the years\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![**Packages actions done by the CRAN Team over time**.
