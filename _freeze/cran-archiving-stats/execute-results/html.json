Using public data available\nfrom different resources[^1] on CRAN, we have found that 36% of the\narchived packages get unarchived at some point [@revilla_2022]. The\nmedian time for these packages to return to CRAN is ~33 days.\n\n[^1]: Data sources used are `tools:::CRAN_current_db()`,\n`tools:::CRAN_archive_db()`, and [PACKAGES.in]. The first holds a data\nframe of packages currently on CRAN, which information on the package\nname, the package version, and the publishing timestamp.  The second\nholds a list of data frames, each comprising the same package\ninformation for all versions ever published on CRAN, except the\ncurrently available version.  The third, holds information on events\nfor packages that have ever been archived, removed, orphaned, etc.\n\n[PACKAGES.in]: https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/PACKAGES.in\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n## Data quality checks\n\nTo make sure our assumptions about the raw input data is valid, we\nwill run some initial quality checks based on the data that are\navailable as of 2024-06-22.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\nA package should never unarchived more times than it is\narchive. However, there are currently 96\npackages unarchived more times than archived. There could be several\nreasons for this:\n\n - one of the previous issues with the package lead to its removal.\n - the term used for annotating an event was different ('orphaned'\n   instead of 'archived').\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n|First action | Packages|\n|:------------|--------:|\n|orphaned     |       85|\n|removed      |       68|\n|archived     |       21|\n|renamed      |        1|\n\n\n\n**Figure: First recorded action taken of a package.** Looking by date most packages' first action recorded is being added to CRAN. For some it isn't.\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe also check what the first recorded event packages have.  If the\nfirst action recorded for a package is not that it is 'accepted', this\ncan indicate some problems on the data that could lead to problems on\nthe conclusions.\n\nA special mention of the 'removed' action: This action is usually\nreserved to copyright issues and it is normal that it is the first\naction in record for a package as previous records are removed too\nfrom CRAN (package source code).\n\nBy contrast, we should not expected lack of records on CRAN of\n'accepted' packages. Based on the current data, this is the case for\n134 packages. This could indicated that packages\nhave been 'renamed' or 'removed'.  Another explanations could be that\nthere was a dialogue between the package maintainers and the CRAN Team\nthat lead to the package being 'unarchived' without new 'accepted'\npackages.  It could be because of a missing entry in the CRAN\ndata.\n\n\n::: {.cell tbl-cap='**Table: Events per package in the same date.** Most packages have just one action per day. Unarchiving usually requires a new package\\'s version accepted the same day.'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n| Multiple actions | Events | % events |\n|:----------------:|:------:|:--------:|\n|        1         | 59814  |   86%    |\n|        2         |  9073  |   13%    |\n|        3         |  331   |    0%    |\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIn total there are 424 'unarchived' events that do not have the corresponding 'accepted' package included event (on the same date).  Currently, this is the case for 412 packages out of 9260 (4%).\n\nOn the contrary, there are some events that are not expected to happen\non the same day:\n\n\n::: {.cell tbl-cap='**Table: Actions that happend on the same date in a given package.** Mostly a new acceptance lead to a package being unarchived.
